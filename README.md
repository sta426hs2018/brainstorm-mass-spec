# Mode of Operation
Four main steps:
1. Sample Preparation  
2. Ionization  
3. Separation  
4. Detection  

<br><br>

1. **Sample preparation:** Usually sample have to be prepared for the analysis by mass spectrometry. Depending on the molecules/samples different procedures do exist. In proteomics, the samples are typically treated by adding denaturating aggents and proteases to diggest the proteins into (charged) peptides. Samples are usually injected via a column to obtain a separation in time of the peptide population.

2. **Ionization:** In order to be able to measure molecules by mass spectrometry they need to be charged. Different operation modes for ionizing (and fragmenting) do exist such as electron spray ionization (ESI), Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation (MALDI) etc.

3. **Separation:** The mass analyzers make use of the charge of molecules. Common techniques are Time-of-flight (TOF), Quadrupole Mass Filters and Ion Traps. Time-of-flight (TOF) is arguably the most basic seperation technique and uses an electrical field in which the charged fragments are accelareted. The time molecules need to cover the distance in the analyzer depends upon the mass of the molecule (assuming equal charge).

4. **Detection:** Detectors are either based on induction or impact. When based on impact, the ion hits the surface and generates electrons, which are then turned into signal, in contrast induction relies upon the current induced of ion passing by the detector.
Sequentially, the mass over charge ratio pattern is recorded.
