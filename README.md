## Data representation and analysis
Data is produced by mass spectrometer. A broad range of mass spectrometers are used, that in turn produces various types of data. Data is most commonly represented in form of mass spectrum (intensity vs.  mass-to-charge ratio plot), which is best represented by a chromatogram, where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents signal intensity.
Other types of mass spectrometry data are well represented as a three-dimensional contour map. In this form, the mass-to-charge ration is on the x-axis, intensity the y-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the z-axis.
Analysis of mass spectra can be done by a computer algorithm called formula generator that calculates all molecular formulas that theoretically fit a given mass with specified tolerance. A recent technique for structure elucidation in mass spectrometry is precursor ion fingerprinting.
